				Hi! I'm Ross. I have a confession, I have a lot of passion in my profession. Ha! Alliteration. In all seriousness
				I love to program. <a href="#" target="_blank">Java</a> is my weapon of choice when developing robust backend applications. When it comes to 
				frontend development, I'm a pro at using <a href="#" target="_blank">AngularJS</a>. When it comes to getting things done, I prefer to
				use agile methods.
			</p>
			<p>
				I'm an indie game developer as well, being a proponent of <a href="#" target="_blank">Unreal</a> technologies, which is matched beautifully with C++.
				Scroll down to see some gamez!
			</p>
			<p>
				When I'm not coding, I play the guitar, game on DotA2, and browse StackOverflow answering questions.

				<h1>Things I'm Passionate About</h1>
			</header>
			<hr class="green-line">
			<p>
				<a href="#">Java</a>
				<br>
				Java was the first programming language I learned! Actually, most of my Java projects are backed with great frameworks like Spring. Can we take a second
				to appreciate Maven as well? It provides such a consistent feel to a language that desperately needed it.
			</p>
			<p>
				<a href="#">AngularJS</a>
				<br>
				I'm very passionate on these up and coming frontend technologies, just because it provides a breath of fresh air into the janky glue that is
				HTML5 + jQuery. AngularJS provides me solace in that I can write real, testible code that is proven to be robust.
			</p>
			<p>
				<a href="#">Unreal Engine 4</a>
				<br>
				I cannot express how much freedom UE4 offers the indie game development community. I should actually opt to be a spokesperson of theirs! The rich UI,
				easy-to-extend classes, and general code structure allow for games to be made seamless and effortless (well, with less effort than other engines!). The reason
				I love it so much? C++, baby! No more esoteric scripting languages here!
			</p>
			<p>
				<a href="#">C.I.</a>
				<br>
				When working with a large team of developers, or heck, even on your own, Continuous Integration is the bees knees for detecting early defects and quick nightlies
				to Q.A.!
			</p>
			<p>
				<a href="#">Github</a>
				<br>
				I have a lot of private repos on Github for my work.

				<h1>Work Experience</h1>
			</header>
			<hr class="purple-line">
			<p>
				<a href="#">GE Lighting</a>
				<br>
				Came in halfway through development of LightGrid, software designed to manage and analyze outdoor lighting systems like highways, parking lots, and street lighting. Worked as a 
				part of a global team of engineers to deliver a solid product. LightGrid was built using JSF and Java initially, but transitioned away from the driftwood that is
				JSF and towards Angular goodness. I valued my time at GE for their global initiative, support, and strives to unifying their platform via the Industrial Internet.
			</p>
			<p>
				<a href="#">Case Western Reserve University</a>
				<br>
				Worked as a research assistant to a professor interested in delivering a high quality video streaming and VoIP service. Worked primarily on the audio side of things.
				Was interesting as a new line of programming I've never done before. Audio code is really intense!
			</p>
			<p>
				<a href="#">ETactics</a>
				<br>
				My first intern job while in college. Was my first taste of working as a part of a time. ETactics provided a peice of software geared towards patient management and
				general chargelines. The application was developed using known Java technology like JSP and general Java servlets, lightweight and awesome.
			</p>
			<p>
				<a href="#">University of Akron</a>
				<br>
				Helped maintain the student portal at the University of Akron using some Oracle technologies. Generally worked on small features and maintanence. Was a fun experience because
				it helped open my eyes to Oracle technologies and also I got to work in between classes!
